Types to implement
==================

First refactor to have a FromMonet trait, central Cursor::get<T:FromMonet>(colnr).
Other Cursor getters are convenience.
ResultSet also gets simpler.

BLOB
UUID

DECIMAL

TIMESTAMP
TIMESTAMPTZ
TIME
TIMETZ
DATE
DAY_INTERVAL
MONTH_INTERVAL
SEC_INTERVAL


Generic get method
------------------

There are multiple decimal libraries and multiple calendar libraries. Possibly,
more than one is enabled, for example if a library uses this crate, and then an
application that uses the library also uses this crate itself, with a different
choice of decimal. In that situation it is not clear who gets to claim the
`get_decimal` method.

The plan was to move to a generic `Cursor::get` method based on a `FromMonet` trait
like so:

```rust
// A type implements FromMonet<'a> if it can be constructed from `&'a [u8]`.

pub trait FromMonet<'a> where Self: Sized,
{
    fn from_monet(bytes: &'a [u8]) -> CursorResult<Self>;
}

// For example, a u8 can be constructed from any byte slice as it doesn't need
// it anymore after construction.

impl<'a> FromMonet<'a> for bool {
    fn from_monet(bytes: &'a [u8]) -> CursorResult<Self>  { todo!() }
}

// A &'x str can be constructed from &'a [u8] as long as 'a outlives 'x.

impl<'a, 'x> FromMonet<'a> for &'x str where 'a: 'x,
{
    fn from_monet(bytes: &'a [u8]) -> CursorResult<Self> { todo!() }
}
```

However, that lifetime gives rise to all kinds of lifetime issues.
Most can be worked around with some effort but we do not want our
users to have to go through that over and over.

It is sufficient to have generic getter for owned types.
