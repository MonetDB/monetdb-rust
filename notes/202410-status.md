=================

Last week I got cursors to work so we can execute simple queries and
iterate over the results.

I have some refactorings in mind, in particular

1. fusing the ServerSocket, the MapiReader and the MapiBuf into a single Mapi
   object because it seems I always use them together

2. doing more result set parsing while reading from the socket,
   it's no use reading faster than the server can write.

It would be nice to get that out of the way but other things may be more urgent.

1. executing with bound parameters

2. support more data types

3. add API documentation

One other super important thing is that there is not enough testing.
Some tricky bits of code have `#[test]` tests but there are no tests
that interact with an actual MonetDB instance.

1. add integration tests.

2. add more unit tests to code that doesn't have any, so far every time I've
   done so I've found bugs

Most of these tasks are already in TODO.org but I need to think about
priorities.

This Thursday I have a presentation where I'll show off monetdb-rust to my
colleagues, what do I want them to see?

1. a package on cargo.io.

2. with a link to docs that look like I'm taking this seriously

3. a reasonable looking demo program

4. unfortunately too early for benchmark results




Plan:

1. [X] tag current work as v0.1.1

2. [X] add license files

3. [ ] Add api docs on Connection and Cursor and make a lot of things not pub anymore

4. [ ] add a few more common data types

5. [ ] give the presentation

6. [ ] refactor the mapi

7. [ ] so I can change result set parsing to happen during reading

8. [ ] so I can keep track of transaction status (&4)

9. [ ] so I can properly support start transaction / commit / rollback
